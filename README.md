## Description
This is my current trading bot work flow.
Meaning in this repo you can find a R&D section and a trading bot section.
The R&D section is basically a data science section which consits of looking for strategies, testing out theories, optimizing strategy parameters, optimizing stoploss and takeprofit parameters, etc.
Then there is the trading bot section which is the actual bot that will be used to trade.
Currently this trading bot section is under major construction as I am in the middle a fully functioning python bot to a c++ bot.
The repo contains the python bot in one directory and the development of the CPP bot in the other.
The bots are designed to run mutliple stragies, on multiple time frames, on multiple assets classes all at once.
The exchanges I am focused on are Kucoin, Onada, and Interactive Brokers.
Also soon I will be adding in an API feed for new events.

## Description
This is my current trading bot work flow.
Meaning in this repo you can find a R&D section and a trading bot section.
The R&D section is basically a data science section which consits of looking for strategies, testing out theories, optimizing strategy parameters, optimizing stoploss and takeprofit parameters, etc.
Then there is the trading bot section which is the actual bot that will be used to trade.
Currently this trading bot section is under construction.
Right now I have a working python bot, but I am migrating it to a C++ bot.
The bots are designed to run mutliple stragies at once, on multiple time frames, on multiple assets classes.
The exchanges I am focused on are Kucoin, Onada, and Interactive Brokers.

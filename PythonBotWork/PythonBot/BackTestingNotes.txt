0. Debug mode is set true


Part 1. Setup before entering the while/forever loop
    A. TODO move this out of the mainFile becuase it sorta is a pain to do look at


Part 2. FOREVER LOOP

WHILE 
    for loop on stragegies

        1. get_new_pandas_info
            A. Live, call API   returns (ifUpdated, whether updated)
            B. Returns the Same (PandasDf, True)
        
        So on backtest the back returns true so
        2. if change to pandas .... NEW INFORMATION!
            make pandas_df = pandas_df
            sooo During the backTest nothing really happens here
            

            
            3. Update State Map 
            --- oh shiitt loooks like a huge issue here
            -- I have two different functions here
            -- That look like they have been mized up
                !!! My biggest issue is the time flag,
                !!! this timeframe setting seems weird and might cause problems for live testing

                A.Live -- Note 100% the pandas works as it should
                B. BackTesting 
                    a. this is where it uses index
                    b. Basically makes a 1 
                        row pandas df from the index
                        i like
            
            4. deciding_to_make_trade based off updated stateMap
                A. For backTesting and Production this function is the same
                B. This just returns a 
                    <dict key:time,
                     value: 
                        <dict keys:
                            trades_to_enter_singal ,
                            exit_trade_singal,
                                value: lists>>
            5. Log trades decide to make on
            6. If orders were decided to be make, make order
                7. Make Orders function
                    --- So there is an issue here
                    Live trading returns 
                    A. Live trading
                    B. Back testing
                8. Proccess orders made
                    A. Live tradine
                    B. Back testing trading
                9. 


            
            
            6.  



So there is a lot of proccess and sub proccesses going on here, for back testing and living trading
- There is trade decision to make trade
- Then there is making a trade
-- Note the information the decision to make the trade was on
-- May change a lot from the time the order is excuted and could be so different that 
-- it wouldn't be a decision I would have made the decision
-- So I should be logging that to.
-- 


HOW SHOULD THE DATA MODEL BE FROM 
    1. DECIDE To order
        A.
    2. Make order
                logging_result_from_trade_made= {
                      'json_response_if_api_call': a,
                      'wasASuccesfulOrder': b,
                      'currency____' : currency__,
                      'amout_I_beleive?' : amountToKnowLater,
                      'price_decsion_to_make_trade_was_based_on': curPrice_,
                      'myTime_decsion_to_make_trade_was_based_on': myTime,
                      'unixTime_decsion_to_make_trade_was_based_on': unixTime,
                      'timeStampFromDecisionToMakeTrade' : timeStamp,
                      }
    3. curr in Orders
        A. defaultDict(lambda: defaultDict(list(logging_result_from_trade_made)  ))
        B. Should add more data or make it a dictionary
    4. exit orders
        A. 
    5. PRocceesing order trades
        A. Returns a list of dictionary of trades exit_trade_singal
            a. Why is this a list and not a dictionary?
    

    666. 
    FINAL this list of exited orders, this might be the most import

        




#TODO
# While times on "time list of times" 
    #So  I have this in stateMap update 
    #And I have this in decide to make trades
    #I think I only need this in decide to make trades



1. So I have the pandas df, iterateing via a index
    A. WHat is the best place to update this index?
        a. I think everytime enetering the while loop
            i. This may change when I turn everything to work on its own threads

2. Get new panas df
    A. How does this differ from live trading and back testing
        a.  

2. How do I collect the signals for everything?
    A. Decide to make trades
        a. For actual use and
        b. Logging
    B. 

So I have a logging

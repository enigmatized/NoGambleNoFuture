###This is to show that the small guy can make money with simple princples.

This is under construction.
Didn't mean to post this yet.

So far:
1. Can backtest strategy with
2. Can simulate trading
3. Can do live currency
4. Can run multiple strageies at a time


5.   TODO: dashboard to track live trading stats
6.   TODO: optimization on limit orders
7.   TODO: python is not the right code for this project, move it over to something else

8.   Coming Soon: some forex exchange do not allow you to be in positions and have multiple limit orders(I believe to prevent spoofing). So I have to create a limit service. 
9.   Coming Soon: Instructions on how to use, how to automate
10.  Coming Soon: Settings to optimize you strategies values for back testings


Creating a trade bot is a pain in the ass. 
You have to first have an idea, get some idea, back testing that idea, then build something to trade that idea.
I am glossing over the fact that backtesting may not represent actual live trading results.
So then you may want to simulate the idea.
Then finally, if you are making momey on the simulation, put real captial to work.
Then there is the maintence of said worker.

This tool is meant to make the above proccess easier.
Easy backtesting of ideas, simulating trades, running a strategy on multiple exchanges, managing risk.
A lot of work to do, but this is the start.

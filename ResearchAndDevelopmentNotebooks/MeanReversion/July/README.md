Wow so mean reversion is very real.

I have been mostly looking at mean reversion of the open to close for a specifc time period
What if I look for this on the range of each time frame as well.
I can test how it stands on its own.
Then I can test how it stands with combining them.
This sounds like this should just be a mean reverting bot.

TODO I didn't create this entirely correct.
There should be a tradeManager class.
Who gets information from each exchangeTradeManager.

So there needs to be a interface for a specifc  Exchange.
Then each Exchange can have its own class.
It will have thier own trade management tracking, some functionality will be unqiue and some will be generic.
Question.
Should they inherit a class that all have the same common functions and also inherit the interface?

//This is actaully a good swe question I want to look into and grappling with later
